The QSE library implements AWK and SED in an embeddable form and defines data types, functions, and classes that you can use when you embed them into an application. It also provides more fundamental data types and functions needed when you deal with memory, streams, data structures. The interface has been designed to be flexible enough to access various aspects of embedding application and an embedded object from each other.
